nginx restart do a syntax check
have drush uli command auto open the browser window


* conf nginx files for people who may not need/want redis/varnish
  * do we just make these requirements?

* do we change the .ifdev for local testing url to be .fulcrum or something similar like .local?

* we have a etc/certs.d with odd things in it

* generate random passwords/keys on install for:
  * or just make everything fulcrum/fulcrum but what about people that might just run this in prod
  haproxy
  ssl certs?
  varnish secret file
  compose files ( seems the local one is fine, IF ones to be removed from public )

* find and remove .bak files

* should docker files go in another repo?

* seems we should decouple the sites and files from fulcrum? allow people to run other similar stacks but not always drupal on fulcrum, git-site-config, howto

* where does the root php folder go

* do we fork xhyve, it seems to have gone quiet and we have a highly customized xhyve.sh

* be sure to extract out the fulcrum deploy pass in boot
