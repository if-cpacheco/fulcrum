issue from SD template that was causing the home page to be unable to cache
==============================================================================

it is line 184-188 of template.php that is causing it not to cache:
$variables['explore_sd_map'] = views_embed_view('locations_map','block_1', $variables['node']->nid);
$variables['attractions_list'] = views_embed_view('attractions_list','block_1', $variables['node']->nid);
$variables['nearby_events'] = views_embed_view('events','block', $variables['node']->nid);
$events_exposed_filter_date = module_invoke('views', 'block_view', '-exp-events-page_1');
$variables['events_exposed_filter_date'] = $events_exposed_filter_date['content'];

drupal_set_messages which are being thrown from undefined indexes and other things, when drupal messages are run, then pages are not cached.

it is from this commit:

https://github.com/IFSight/sandiego/commit/39b1f1a66f1b14172e8106197e3a6b188be8ddcb

3 of the 5 lines reference a node which does not exist since the front page is not a node, and the other two have an issue with the date/view.

when commented out the page is cached perfectly

this can also be accomplished by turning off the on screen error logging:
